    <center><h3> Season 1</h3></center>
    <p>Game of Thrones takes place on a fictional continent called Westeros in a time who-knows-when where the land is divided into a bunch of kingdoms and when we jump into Season 1 we learn they are all ruled by one king, Robert Baratheon, whose second-in-command Jon Arryn—the post is called "the Hand of the King"—was just murdered, so King Robert sets out for the North to ask his old buddy, the honorable Ned Stark of Winterfell, to replace Jon as the Hand but Ned was wary because, you know, murder and all, and he'd be away from his wonderful family—wife Catelyn, sons from eldest to youngest heir Robb, curious Bran, and very young Rickon, daughters princess-wannabe Sansa and tomboy Arya, and bastard son Jon Snow as well as all their oversized direwolf pets—but Ned ultimately agrees take on the role that's good because Robert needs someone he can trust since his wife Queen Cersei and her brother Jaime Lannister are sketchy and totally having incest sex which isn't all that weird for this show because family relationships are weird in Game of Thrones and if you need more proof there's Danaerys Targaryen (call her Dany) and her brother Viserys, who is exiled royalty from the regime that ruled before Robert, who lived in secrecy in the nearby sandbox continent of Essos and the weird family stuff comes in because Viserys tries to sell Dany to a barbarian horde known as the Dothraki so that Viserys could use the Dothraki as an army to regain the power that was in his family's right until Jamie killed his father, "the Mad King"—but Viserys never actually gets the power he's so hungry for because he gets killed by Dany's doggy-style-sexing barbarian husband, Khal Drogo, and Dany eventually siezes power of the barbarian horde, which she plans on using to re-take Westeros, which has its own problems after Robert (the king) dies on a hunting trip and Robert's idiot son Joffrey takes over the throne even though he technically has no right to it because he's actually the son of his mom Queen Cersei and his uncle Jaime, which Ned (the Hand) discovers, announces, and is subsequently thrown in jail and later beheaded for in front of his daughters, including Sansa, who is betrothed to Joffrey (ugh) who really starts being a jerk when he becomes king and that upsets everyone so other people claim to be king including the late Robert's brother Renly and Robb Stark, who goes on to capture Jamie and get lots of support from other lords in the North unlike his bastard bro Jon Snow who's headed north to the Wall and joined a team of outcasts that's tasked with keeping all sorts of things like ice zombies (actually they're Wights, and have been frozen for a long time but are now awakening) from messing things up except the zombies ARE starting to mess things up and unfortunately for everyone Joffrey is too concerned with his own crown to bother with ice zombies, and all we can hope for is that Joffrey's new Hand of the King, his cool, alcoholic, smooth-talking, sex-addicted dwarf uncle Tyrion, can talk some sense into him but it might not even matter at all because pulling the strings behind the scenes at all times are a eunuch named Varys and a pimp named Littlefinger and they both have incredible amounts of sway when it comes to keeping order in the realm, which might be in even bigger trouble because in the season finale Dany hatched some dragon eggs and one thing you don't want to do is mess with a pissed-off teen queen with three dragons on her side.</p>

    <center><h3> Season 2</h3></center>
<p>Season 2 spans several months on a world where the seasons last for years at a time. The Seven Kingdoms are at war, with the King in the North, Robb Stark, fighting to win independence for his people and those of the Riverlands. Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent ironborn to his cause, and sends his best friend Theon Greyjoy to treat with his father, who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, Joffrey Baratheon holds the Iron Throne with the backing of the powerful House Lannister, but his uncle Renly has also claimed the throne with the support of House Tyrell, whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, Tyrion Lannister arrives in King's Landing to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister, Cersei, now the Queen Regent. However, there is another faction entering the picture. Stannis Baratheon, Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of several wars, Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is Melisandre, an enigmatic priestess from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a greater destiny , and Ser Davos Seaworth, an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court. Far to the east, Daenerys Targaryen has hatched the only three dragons in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her khalasar gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a forbidding wasteland and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne. In the distant north, the Night's Watch has mounted an expedition beyond the Wall, searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of wildlings gathering in the mountains. For Jon Snow this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself. </p>

    <center><h3> Season 3</h3></center>
<p> After defeating Stannis Baratheon at the Battle of the Blackwater, the Lannisters hold a firm grasp on the Iron Throne. They are threatened by their new ally House Tyrell, powerful and manipulative players of the game. Tyrion Lannister struggles with losing the power he had as Hand of the King, and feels his father doesn't appreciate the service he provided the family as Hand. Meanwhile, Jaime Lannister continues his attempt to return home, and begins to form a bond with his road companion, Brienne of Tarth. The Starks find themselves losing the war. They lost the support of Lord Walder Frey, after Robb Stark broke his vow to him by marrying Talisa Maegyr, and many members of Robb's army are losing faith in him. His relationship with his mother has also turned icy after her freeing of Jaime Lannister, though the reported deaths of her father and the younger Stark boys brings them closer. In reality, Bran and Rickon Stark are alive and continuing their journey north, with new strange allies in the Reed siblings. It was Theon Greyjoy who faked the Stark boys' deaths, and is now being physically tortured under an unknown person's command. However, a mysterious boy claiming to be sent by Theons's sister plans to aid his escape. Arya Stark, on her journey home with companions Gendry and Hot Pie, finds herself entangled with The Brotherhood without Banners and Sandor "The Hound" Clegane.

At Dragonstone, Stannis Baratheon appears a broken man after being crushed at the Battle of the Blackwater. His advisor Ser Davos is imprisoned after attempting to kill Melisandre, who still believes her god, the Lord of Light, will help Stannis return to prominence. Beyond the Wall, Jon Snow joins Mance Rayder's wildling army, but with hidden intentions. His vows are tested more than ever by a growing romance with wildling Ygritte, as he finds that he will have to choose between her and the Night's Watch. The latter has been largely decimated by a White Walker attack, and a group of them is making their way back to the Wall. However, many of the rangers find themselves also questioning their vows, putting Lord Commander Mormont's and Samwell Tarly's lives in danger. Across the Narrow sea in Astapor, Daenerys Targaryen continues her quest to reclaim the seven kingdoms. She has a new companion in former King's Guard commander Barristan Selmy, and is still advised by Jorah Mormont. She contemplates buying the Unsullied, an elite army of harshly trained eunuchs.
